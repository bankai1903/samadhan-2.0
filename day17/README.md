# Day 17: Real-time Chat App with Socket.io 💬

👨‍💻 Today, I built my first real-time application! I created a live chat room using **Socket.io**, where users can join, send messages, and see who's online instantly, without any page reloads. This project was a fascinating introduction to the world of WebSockets and bidirectional communication.

## 🧠 Key Concepts I Learned

1.  **HTTP vs. WebSockets:** I learned that the traditional request-response model of HTTP is not ideal for real-time features. **WebSockets** provide a persistent, two-way communication channel between a client and a server, allowing the server to push information to the client at any time. 
2.  **Socket.io:** This is a powerful library that simplifies working with WebSockets. It provides an event-based system that is very intuitive.
    * `emit()`: Used to send an event (e.g., a message).
    * `on()`: Used to listen for and react to an event.
    * It also handles things like automatic reconnection, making development much smoother.

3.  **Server-side Logic:** The backend Express server now also runs a Socket.io server. It listens for new client connections. When a user sends a message, the server receives it and then **broadcasts** it to all other connected clients instantly.

4.  **Client-side Logic:** The React app connects to the socket server. It has event listeners to handle incoming messages (updating the chat window) and emits events to the server when the user sends a new message.

## ✨ Features Implemented

* **Live Messaging:** Users can send messages that appear instantly for everyone in the chat room.
* **User Status Notifications:** A message is broadcast to the room when a new user joins or an existing user leaves.
* **Simple "Join" Screen:** Users enter a username before joining the chat.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

### 1. Run the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies and start
npm install
npm start
# The backend will be running on http://localhost:4000
```

### 2. Run the Frontend

```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies and start
npm install
npm start
# The frontend will open and run on http://localhost:3000
```
